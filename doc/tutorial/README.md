The grand plan for this tutorial is to learn how to serialize/deserialize any object efficiently in time and space, so you could focus on other, more interesting things.


This tutorial will cover these main topics:
* [Hello World](hello_world.md) how to set up and to serialize a [fundamental value](../design/fundamental.md).
* [2 in 1](two_in_one.md) how to write one control flow for both, serialization and deserialization.
* [Squeeze Me!](compression.md) how to compress your data if you know what it stores.
* [Anything is Possible](extensions.md) how to extend library for your custom container, compress geometry and more.
* [Little or Big](endianness.md) how to change Endianness if you want best performance on PowerPC
